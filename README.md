This is the client side of the Feed Reader application. 

The Feed Reader application is a secure web application where you manage feeds in widgets. Widgets are the short summaries of the parsed feeds. They display linked titles of the blog posts/news. This application is influenced from the good old iGoogle implementation.

Angular, ng-bootstrap, Luxon technologies are used.

You can see this application running on heroku:

You can use following users in the application (username/password/role):

- **user/user**/USER
- **admin/admin**/ADMIN
